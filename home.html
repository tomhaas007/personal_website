    <h1>Hi, I'm Tom.</h1>
    <p>I’m a business student from Germany. But I really rather identify as a European. Currenlty, I’m doing my Master’s in Lisbon, Portugal. Well, at least I’m in Lisbon for this semester, we’ll see where I’ll be able to go to next. Travelling is one of my biggest passions. Apart from that, I’m interested in many things. Especially sustainability and digitalization are very important to me. I love designing, building and developing products which have a positive impact in some way on the world. If you’re interested in working with me or just want to learn more about me, feel free to keep reading. <br><br> Best, Tom</p>

    <h4>A little bit about me.</h4>
    <p>I grew up in Böblingen, Germany, a small town close to Stuttgart. I graduated from ESB Business School (Reutlingen) in 2019 with a Bachelor degree in International Business. During my studies I was lucky enough to spend an exchange semester in Buenos Aires, Argentina at Universidad Austral, which I enjoyed a lot. This was also one of the reasons for me to decide to pursue my Master’s education in a foreign country. I’m super excited to begin this journey starting in summer/fall 2020 in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>

    <h4>What I enjoy doing.</h4>
    <div class="content_grid_projects">
      <h5>Design</h5>
      <p class="white_text">I had always had a strong sense for design and visuality. I’m not a professional designer, but I do enjoy designing digital products such as websites and mobile apps.</p>
      <h5>Development</h5>
      <p class="white_text">I have always had the urge to build products or really anything on my own. However, I’m not a craftsmen in the classic sense. Coding gives me the ability to develop and create actual products, which I absolutely love.</p>
      <h5>Management</h5>
      <p class="white_text">I love working with people. And I really enjoy bringing ideas into life and every aspect this entails. From Project Management, to Communication Management and Business Development.</p>
